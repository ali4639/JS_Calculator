My name is Ali Azarban, I am a master's student of Islamic Azad University, Urmia branch from Iran, I am interested in working in the field of web programming. In the recent project, I came and simulated a classic and old calculator for you, to design and build this software I have used HTML and CSS for beautification and JAVASCRIPT programming language for coding and interactions of the program. It was enjoyable for me personally and I learned some interesting points, especially in the operations section, take a look at the codes and you will understand. To start the program, download all the files and place them in a folder on your system, then run the index.html file through one of the browsers.
